# IBM Cloud Private Certificate Manager Webhook

## Introduction
This chart deploys the IBM Cloud Private certificate manager webhook service that can be used to validate resources created for IBM Cloud Private certificate manager service.

## Chart Details
One instance of cert-manager-webhook is deployed to a single master node when IBM Cloud Private is installed.

## How to use IBM-Cert-Manager webhook
See the IBM Cloud Private product documentation in the [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/) for more details on cert-manager-webhook, IBM Cloud Private's Kubernetes certificate manager service.

## Prerequisites
* Kubernetes version 1.13 or above
* Helm version 2.9 or above

### PodSecurityPolicy Requirements
The predefined `PodSecurityPolicy` name: [`ibm-privileged-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp) has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this `PodSecurityPolicy` you can proceed to install the chart.

This chart also defines a custom `PodSecurityPolicy` which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart. You can enable this custom `PodSecurityPolicy` using the IBM Cloud Private management console. Note that this `PodSecurityPolicy` is already defined in IBM Cloud Private 3.1.1 or higher.

- From the user interface, you can copy and paste the following snippets to enable the custom `PodSecurityPolicy` into the create resource section
  - Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/description: "This policy is the most restrictive,
          requiring pods to run with a non-root UID, and preventing pods from accessing the host."
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: runtime/default
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: runtime/default
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: docker/default
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: docker/default
      name: ibm-restricted-psp
    spec:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      forbiddenSysctls:
      - '*'
      fsGroup:
        ranges:
        - max: 65535
          min: 1
        rule: MustRunAs
      requiredDropCapabilities:
      - ALL
      runAsUser:
        rule: MustRunAsNonRoot
      seLinux:
        rule: RunAsAny
      supplementalGroups:
        ranges:
        - max: 65535
          min: 1
        rule: MustRunAs
      volumes:
      - configMap
      - emptyDir
      - projected
      - secret
      - downwardAPI
      - persistentVolumeClaim
    ```
  - Custom ClusterRole for the custom PodSecurityPolicy:
    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: ibm-restricted-psp-clusterrole
    rules:
    - apiGroups:
      - extensions
      resourceNames:
      - ibm-restricted-psp
      resources:
      - podsecuritypolicies
      verbs:
      - use
    ```

## Resources Required
* None

## Installing the Chart
One instance of the cert-manager-webhook chart comes installed with IBM Cloud Private. If it is not installed, then run the following `helm` command to install it:

```bash
helm install -n ibm-cert-manager-webhook --namespace cert-manager <path to chart>/ibm-cert-manager-webhook --tls
```

You can also install it from the IBM Cloud Private management console by navigating to either the Helm Releases page or the Catalog page and searching for `ibm-cert-manager-webhook`. 

## Configuration
Changes to configuration can be made in the values.yaml file or in a values-override.yaml where it will override the values in values.yaml.

To install or upgrade the chart with a values-override.yaml, the `helm` command would look like this:
```bash
helm upgrade ibm-cert-manager-webhook --force -f values-override.yaml ibm-cert-manager-webhook-chart --tls
```

### Red Hat OpenShift SecurityContextConstraints Requirements
This chart requires a SecurityContextConstraints to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. To meet this requirement there may be cluster scoped as well as namespace scoped pre and post actions that need to occur.

The predefined SecurityContextConstraints name: [`ibm-privileged-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc) has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this SecurityContextConstraints resource you can proceed to install the chart.

This chart also defines a custom SecurityContextConstraints which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart. You can enable this custom SecurityContextConstraints resource using the supplied instructions/scripts in the pak_extension pre-install directory.

- From the user interface, you can copy and paste the following snippets to enable the custom SecurityContextConstraints
  - Custom SecurityContextConstraints definition:
    ```
    apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
    kind: SecurityContextConstraints
    metadata:
      name: ibm-chart-dev-scc
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
    allowedCapabilities:
    - CHOWN
    - DAC_OVERRIDE
    - SETGID
    - SETUID
    - NET_BIND_SERVICE
    seLinux:
      type: RunAsAny
    supplementalGroups:
      type: RunAsAny
    runAsUser:
      type: RunAsAny
    fsGroup:
      rule: RunAsAny
    volumes:
    - configMap
    - secret
    ```
## Limitations
* There can only be a single deployment of the certificate manager service in a cluster, and it is installed by default.
